## **Goals of the weeks**

- [x] Use at least 1 API

- [x] Make your API calls from the back-end using the Request module .

- [x] Your server should contain a minimum of 2 routes

- [x] We expect back-end testing using Tape (test as many components as you can) and basic front-end testing.

- [x] Test your server by injecting fake HTTP requests using Supertest (consider testing for 404's and 500's).

- [x] Host your project on Heroku.

- [x] Use module.exports and require to break a single large server file into smaller modules.

- [x] Consider a good server file structure based on what we have discussed over the week.


- [x] Include Error Handling.
